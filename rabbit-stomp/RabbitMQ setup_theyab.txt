What can RabbitMQ do for you?

Messaging enables software applications to connect and scale. Applications can connect to each other, as components of a larger application, or to user devices and data. Messaging is asynchronous, decoupling applications by separating sending and receiving data.

You may be thinking of data delivery, non-blocking operations or push notifications. Or you want to use publish / subscribe, asynchronous processing, or work queues. All these are patterns, and they form part of messaging.

RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to live until received.
